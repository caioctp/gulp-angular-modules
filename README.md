ng-autoinject
=============

I love using gulp-inject. It's a great task that can take care of dynamically including your JavaScript and bower files into your index.html file using for example gulp-watch and BrowserSync.

I wanted to do something similar: include all my modules as a depedency of my Angular.js application without having to enter the file by hand each time.

So now, when I'm adding a new module, automatically adds the file into the index.html, includes the module as a dependency in my project and reloads the browser. How cool is that?

## Usage

1) Setup your Angular.js project to only include one dependency: 'autoinject'
angular.module('app', ['autoinject']);

2) Add into your index.html the future autogenerated autoinject.js file location.

3) Create a task (gulp/grunt) to run:


```javascript
require("ng-autoinject")({
    module: {name: "autoinject", path: "app/src/init/autoinject.js"},
    path: ["app/src/**/*.js"],
    exclude: ["app/src/_templates/*"],
    modules: ['ui.router']
});
```
