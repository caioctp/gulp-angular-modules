ng-inject
=============

WORK IN PROGRESS


I love using [gulp-inject](https://github.com/klei/gulp-inject). It's a great task that can take care of dynamically including your JavaScript and bower files into your index.html file using for example gulp-watch and [BrowserSync](https://github.com/shakyShane/browser-sync).

I wanted to do something similar: include all my modules as a depedency of my `Angular.js` application without having to enter the module name by hand each time.

So now, when I'm adding a new module, automatically adds the file into the index.html, includes the module as a dependency in my project and reloads the browser. How cool is that?

## Usage

1) Setup your Angular.js project to only include one dependency: 'autoinject'
```javascript
// app/src/main.js
angular.module('app', ['ng-inject']);
```


2) Add into your index.html the future autogenerated autoinject.js file location.
```html
<script src="app/src/init/ng-inject.js">
```

3) Create a task (gulp/grunt) to run:


```javascript
require("ng-inject")({
    module: {name: "ng-inject", path: "app/src/init/ng-inject.js"},
    path: ["app/src/**/*.js"],
    exclude: ["app/src/_templates/*"],
    modules: ['ui.router']
});
```
